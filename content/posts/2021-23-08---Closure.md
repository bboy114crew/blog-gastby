## Closure is the most esoteric of JavaScript concepts
- Enables powerful pro-level functions like ‘once’ and ‘memoize’
- Many JavaScript design patterns including the module pattern use closure
- Build iterators, handle partial application and maintain state in an
asynchronous world

### Functions with memories
When our functions get called, we create a live store of data (local memory/variable environment/state) for that function’s execution context.
When the function finishes executing, its local memory is deleted (except the returned value)
But what if our functions could hold on to live data between executions?
This would let our function definitions have an associated cache/persistent memory
But it all starts with us returning a function from another function

Functions can be returned from other functions in JavaScript:
```javascript
function createFunction() {
  function multiplyBy2 (num){
    return num*2;
  }
  return multiplyBy2;
}
const generatedFunc = createFunction();
const result = generatedFunc(3); // 6
```

Calling a function in the same function call as it was defined:
```javascript
function outer (){
  let counter = 0;
  function incrementCounter (){
    counter ++;
  }
  incrementCounter();
}
outer();
```

Calling a function outside of the function call in which it was defined:
```javascript
function outer (){
  let counter = 0;
  function incrementCounter (){ counter ++; }
  return incrementCounter;
}
const myNewFunction = outer();
myNewFunction();
myNewFunction();
```

### When a function is defined, it gets a bond to the surrounding Local Memory (“Variable Environment”) in which it has been defined
- We return ```incrementCounter```’s code (function definition) out of outer into
global and give it a new name - ```myNewFunction```
- We maintain the bond to outer’s live local memory - it gets ‘returned out’
attached on the back of ```incrementCounter```’s function definition.
- So outer’s local memory is now stored attached to ```myNewFunction``` - even
though outer’s execution context is long gone
- When we run ```myNewFunction``` in global, it will first look in its own local
memory first (as we’d expect), but then in ```myNewFunction```’s ‘backpack’

### What can we call this ‘backpack’?
- Closed over <strong><em>Variable Environment</em></strong> (C.O.V.E.)
- Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data (P.L.S.R.D.)
- <strong><em>Backpack</em></strong>
- <strong><em>Closure</em></strong>
The <strong><em>backpack</em></strong> (or <strong><em>closure</em></strong>) of live data is attached incrementCounter (then to ```myNewFunction```) through a hidden property known as ```[[scope]]``` which persists when the inner function is returned out

### Let’s run ```outer``` again
```javascript
function outer (){
  let counter = 0;
  function incrementCounter (){
    counter ++;
  }
  return incrementCounter;
}

const myNewFunction = outer();
myNewFunction();
myNewFunction();
const anotherFunction = outer();
anotherFunction();
anotherFunction();
```

If we run ```outer``` again and store the returned ```incrementCounter``` function definition in ```anotherFunction```, this new ```incrementCounter``` function was created in a new execution context and therefore has a brand new independent <strong><em>backpack</em></strong>

### Closure gives our functions persistent memories and entirely new toolkit for writing professional code

- **Helper functions:** Everyday professional helper functions like <strong><em>once</em></strong> and <strong><em>memoize</em></strong> <br>
- **Iterators and generators:** Which use lexical scoping and closure to achieve the most contemporary patterns for handling data in JavaScript<br>
- **Module pattern:** Preserve state for the life of an application without polluting the global namespace<br>
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks and Promises rely on closure to persist state in an asynchronous environment<br>
